# Implementing-Least-Cost-Any-Path-Routing-on-L3-Network-Layer

In the following codes we made functions for various network graphs with their corresponding costs.
The cost or the ETX here is the minimum number of transmissions each node has to make to ensure that the packet of data is successfully reached the forward node.
The main objective of these programmes is to find the least number of transitions that has to be made in order to ensure that the packet has reached the destination node/s.
